## README.md

Estimate the cost of prepaid tokens for domestic consumers on the KPLC DC tariff prior to paying for them.  

Runs on [Google App Engine.](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) 
 
The various charges and levies are obtained from public information available in the 
[Kenya gazette](http://kenyalaw.org/kenya_gazette/). Please note that KPLC updates the official rates in the Kenya gazette towards end month and therefore the rates used will lag behind by a month or so.


##Fair warning
I did this as a learning project for [Go](http://golang.org). Thus the code itself is at a beginner level thus it is quite easy to follow in most parts, and needlessly convoluted in some.  Fork and upgrade it!
